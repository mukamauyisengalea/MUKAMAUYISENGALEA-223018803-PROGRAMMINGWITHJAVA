 **Supermarket Billing System – Case Study Overview**

**Purpose of the Project1**
This project is designed to help a supermarket owner streamline the billing process. Instead of manually calculating the cost of each item a customer buys—which can be slow and prone to mistakes—the system automates everything. It ensures faster checkout, accurate totals, and smart discount handling.


**Why This Project Matters**

**Real-World Impact**

- Efficiency Boost: Cashiers can process purchases faster, reducing long queues and improving customer satisfaction.
- Error Reduction: Manual calculations often lead to mistakes. This system ensures precision in billing.
- Smart Discounts: Automatically applies a discount when the total exceeds a certain amount, encouraging bulk purchases and rewarding customers.

  **Business Benefits**
- Saves time and labor costs.
- Enhances professionalism and trust with customers.
- Makes daily sales tracking easier for the owner.

 **Learning Outcomes for Students**
This project is a fantastic way to learn key programming concepts in a practical setting:
 Variables
Used to store item names, prices, quantities, and totals—just like a digital memory.
 Arrays (or Lists)
Can be used to organize multiple items efficiently, making it easier to manage and display them.
 Arithmetic Operators
Essential for calculating subtotals, totals, and discounts—core to any billing system.
 For Loop
Allows the program to repeat actions for each item the customer buys. It’s like telling the computer: “Do this for every product.”
 Conditional Statements
Used to check if the total bill qualifies for a discount. This teaches decision-making logic in programming.


**What the Program Does**
- Asks how many different items were purchased.
- For each item, it collects:
- Name of the item
- Price per unit
- Quantity purchased
- Calculates the subtotal for each item and adds it to the grand total.
- If the total is more than 50,000, it applies a 5% discount.
- Prints a clean receipt showing:
- Each item’s details
- Total before discount
- Discount amount
- Final amount to be paid

**Why It’s a Great Beginner Project**
- It’s relatable—everyone shops!
- It combines multiple programming concepts in one cohesive task.
- It builds confidence by showing how code can solve real problems.
